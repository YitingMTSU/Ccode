C and C++ code

Project_1.zip is the data file for COMS 7100 Applied Computational Science.   
And the corresponding code is Yiting_project1.cc  

booklist.txt is the data file for COMS 6100 Fundamental of Computational Science.  
And the booklist.cpp is the code for it.  

The file cities.dat is the data file for COMS 6100 Fundamental of Computational Science.  
And the flight.cc and flight.h are the head flie and class functions. final-yw3c.cc is the main function.  

Professor gave us the main function ola.cc and data file request.dat. (COMS 6100 Fundamental of Computational Science)  
Require for a class and head file. (Vehicle.cc and Vehicle.h)
